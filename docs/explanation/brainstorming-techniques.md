Carson's brainstorming workflow offers 36 techniques across seven categories, drawing from decades of facilitation research and practice.

## Why Technique Choice Matters

Different techniques serve different purposes:

| Goal | Best Technique Category |
| ---- | ----------------------- |
| **Generate many ideas fast** | Collaborative, Wild |
| **Break out of conventional thinking** | Creative, Theatrical |
| **Understand the problem deeply** | Deep, Introspective |
| **Systematically explore options** | Structured |
| **Build team alignment** | Collaborative |

## Technique Categories

### Collaborative Techniques

Build on group intelligence and collective creativity.

| Technique | How It Works | When to Use |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| **Brainwriting** | Silent written ideation, then build on others' ideas | Teams with dominant voices |
| **Round Robin** | Each person contributes one idea in turn | Equal participation needed |
| **Six Thinking Hats** | Explore from six perspectives (facts, feelings, caution, etc.) | Complex, multi-faceted problems |
| **Brainwalking** | Write ideas, rotate stations, build on what you find | High-energy team sessions |

### Structured Techniques

Systematic approaches that leave no creative stone unturned.

| Technique | How It Works | When to Use |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| **SCAMPER** | Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other use, Eliminate, Reverse | Improving existing products/services |
| **Reverse Brainstorming** | How to cause the problem, then flip to solutions | Stuck on conventional approaches |
| **Morphological Analysis** | Matrix of parameters, combine systematically | Complex systems with many variables |
| **Chunking** | Break into smaller parts, ideate each, recombine | Large, overwhelming challenges |

### Creative Techniques

Unconventional approaches that spark unexpected connections.

| Technique | How It Works | When to Use |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| **Metaphors** | "How is this problem like a garden?" | Need fresh perspective |
| **Random Word** | Force connection between topic and random word | Completely stuck, need surprise |
| **Forced Connections** | Combine two unrelated concepts | Innovation through juxtaposition |
| **Analogical Thinking** | Borrow solutions from other domains | Cross-industry inspiration |

### Deep Techniques

Dig beneath surface understanding to find root causes and hidden opportunities.

| Technique | How It Works | When to Use |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| **Five Whys** | Ask "why" five times to drill down | Quick root cause exploration |
| **Laddering** | Move up to abstraction, down to specifics | Understand values and details |
| **Assumption Surfacing** | List and challenge hidden assumptions | Conventional thinking blocks progress |
| **Problem Reversal** | State problem backwards, flip to solutions | Seeing the problem afresh |

### Theatrical Techniques

Use role-play and scenario thinking to bypass psychological barriers.

| Technique | How It Works | When to Use |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| **Role Storming** | Ideate as someone else (CEO, child, competitor) | Need different perspectives |
| **Hero's Journey** | Frame challenge as narrative adventure | Meaningful, human-centered challenges |
| **Future Press Release** | Write as if future success already happened | Visioning and goal-setting |
| **Pre-mortem** | Assume failure, work backward to causes | Risk identification and prevention |

### Wild Techniques

Embrace absurdity to bypass internal censors and find truly novel ideas.

| Technique | How It Works | When to Use |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| **Worst Possible Idea** | Intentionally generate terrible ideas | Teams afraid of bad ideas |
| **Anti-Problems** | Solve the opposite of your problem | Reframing stubborn challenges |
| **Exaggeration** | Blow up aspects to ridiculous proportions | Find what truly matters |
| **100 Ideas** | Generate 100 ideas in 20 minutes | Break through to novel territory |

### Introspective Techniques

Tap into subconscious creativity through individual reflection.

| Technique | How It Works | When to Use |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| **Guided Imagery** | Visual meditation on the challenge | Accessing intuitive knowledge |
| **Incubation** | Set problem aside, let subconscious work | Stuck after conscious effort exhausted |
| **Dream Capture** | Record and explore dream insights | Subconscious material wanted |
| **Stream of Consciousness** | Write without stopping or editing | Bypassing internal critic |

## How Carson Recommends Techniques

Carson considers three factors when suggesting approaches:

| Factor | Questions |
| ------- | ---------- |
| **Your goal** | What outcome matters most? |
| **Your context** | Team or solo? How much time? |
| **Your energy** | Fresh and excited or tired and stuck? |

Based on your answers, Carson recommends techniques most likely to generate breakthrough.

## Combining Techniques

For comprehensive exploration, try multiple techniques in sequence:

1. **Start structured** — SCAMPER or Reverse Brainstorming to map space
2. **Go creative** — Metaphors or Random Word for surprise
3. **End wild** — Worst Possible Idea to break any remaining constraints

Each technique accesses different creative pathways. Sequencing creates richer results.
