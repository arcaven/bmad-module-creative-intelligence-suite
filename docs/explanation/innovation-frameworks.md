description: Strategic frameworks for finding and capturing new value
---

Victor's innovation strategy workflow applies proven business and innovation frameworks to identify disruption opportunities and design sustainable competitive advantage.

## What Are Innovation Frameworks?

Innovation frameworks are structured approaches to finding and capturing new value. Unlike brainstorming (which generates ideas) or design thinking (which solves user problems), innovation frameworks focus on business model innovation and strategic positioning.

| Framework | Primary Question |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| **Jobs-to-be-Done** | What are customers actually trying to accomplish? |
| **Blue Ocean Strategy** | Where is uncontested market space? |
| **Disruptive Innovation** | How can we attack from the edges? |
| **Business Model Canvas** | How do we create and capture value? |

## Jobs-to-be-Done

**Core insight:** Customers "hire" products to do a job. Understanding the job reveals innovation opportunities product features miss.

| Traditional Thinking | Jobs-to-be-Done Thinking |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| "Millennials want healthy snacks" | "People need to feel productive between meals" |
| "Add more protein bars" | "Make it easy to get sustained energy" |

### The Framework

1. **Identify the job** — What is the customer trying to accomplish?
2. **Understand context** — When, where, and with what constraints?
3. **Find struggles** - Where does current solutions fail?
4. **Innovate on the job** — How can the job be done better?

Victor relentlessly asks: "What job are they hiring this product to do?" The answer often reveals the real opportunity space.

## Blue Ocean Strategy

**Core insight:** Don't compete in crowded "red oceans"—create "blue oceans" of uncontested market space.

| Red Ocean | Blue Ocean |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Compete in existing market | Create new market |
| Beat the competition | Make competition irrelevant |
| Exploit existing demand | Create new demand |
| Align cost/value trade-off | Break the trade-off |

### The Framework

1. **Eliminate** — What factors should be removed?
2. **Reduce** — What should be reduced below industry standard?
3. **Raise** — What should be raised above industry standard?
4. **Create** — What should be created that never existed?

**Example:** Cirque du Soleil eliminated animals and star performers, reduced show variety, raised artistic and music quality, and created a new adult theatrical experience.

## Disruptive Innovation

**Core insight:** Incumbents over-serve mainstream customers while overlooking segments. Disruptors enter ignored segments and improve.

| Disruption Type | Pattern |
| --------------- | ------- |
| **Low-end** | Serve customers incumbents ignore, improve upmarket |
| **New-market** | Serve non-consumers with simpler, more convenient solution |

### The Framework

1. **Identify overserved customers** — Who gets more than they need?
2. **Find non-consumers** — Who can't use current solutions?
3. **Simplify** — What can be removed while still delivering value?
4. **Improve rapidly** — Move upmarket over time

:::caution[Not All Innovation Is Disruption]
True disruption follows specific patterns. Most "disruptive" claims are just incremental improvement. Victor distinguishes real from rhetoric.

## Business Model Canvas

**Core insight:** How you create and deliver value matters as much as what you create. Business model innovation beats product innovation.

### The Nine Building Blocks

| Block | Question |
| ----- | -------- |
| **Value Proposition** | What value do we deliver? |
| **Customer Segments** | Who do we serve? |
| **Channels** | How do we reach them? |
| **Customer Relationships** | How do we interact? |
| **Revenue Streams** | How do we make money? |
| **Key Resources** | What assets do we need? |
| **Key Activities** | What must we do? |
| **Key Partnerships** | Who helps us? |
| **Cost Structure** | What does it cost? |

### Business Model Innovation Patterns

| Pattern | Example |
| ------- | ------- |
| **Freemium** — Free basic, paid premium | Spotify, Dropbox |
| **Subscription** — Recurring revenue | Netflix, software as service |
| **Marketplace** — Connect buyers and sellers | Uber, Airbnb |
| **Razor & Blades** — Cheap hardware, expensive consumables | Printers, Keurig |

## When to Use Which Framework

| Situation | Best Framework |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| **Understanding customer motivation** | Jobs-to-be-Done |
| **Finding uncontested space** | Blue Ocean Strategy |
| **Analyzing competitive dynamics** | Disruptive Innovation |
| **Designing/reinventing business model** | Business Model Canvas |

Victor often combines frameworks. Jobs-to-be-Done reveals the opportunity; Blue Ocean positions it; Business Model Canvas monetizes it.

## Innovation vs. Strategy

| Innovation | Strategy |
| ---------- | --------- |
| Creating new value | Capturing value created |
| What to do | How to win |
| Options and alternatives | Choices and commitments |
| Divergent thinking | Convergent choices |

CIS innovation strategy workflows bridge both—generating options then making strategic choices.
