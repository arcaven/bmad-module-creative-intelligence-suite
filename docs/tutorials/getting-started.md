## Understanding CIS

The Creative Intelligence Suite (CIS) extends BMad Method with tools for the fuzzy front-end of development—where ideas are born, problems are reframed, and solutions emerge through structured creativity.

### CIS Agents and Workflows

| Agent | Workflow | Purpose |
| ----- | -------- | ------- |
| **Carson** | `brainstorming` | Generate ideas using 36 techniques across 7 categories |
| **Maya** | `design-thinking` | Human-centered design through 5 phases |
| **Victor** | `innovation-strategy` | Identify disruption opportunities and business model innovation |
| **Dr. Quinn** | `problem-solving` | Systematic problem diagnosis and root cause analysis |
| **Sophia** | `storytelling` | Craft compelling narratives using 25 story frameworks |
| **Caravaggio** | *(coming soon)* | Structure persuasive presentations |

### When to Use CIS

| Situation | Use This |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| Stuck on a problem | `/cis-problem-solving` |
| Need fresh ideas | `/cis-brainstorm` |
| Designing for users | `/cis-design-thinking` |
| Finding market gaps | `/cis-innovation-strategy` |
| Telling your story | `/cis-storytelling` |

## Installation

CIS installs as a module during BMad Method setup. If you haven't installed BMad Method yet:

```bash
npx bmad-method install
```

When prompted to select modules, choose **Creative Intelligence Suite**.

The installer adds CIS agents and workflows to your `_bmad/` folder.

:::note[Already have BMad Method installed?]
Run the installer again and select Creative Intelligence Suite to add it to your existing setup.

## Step 1: Your First Brainstorming Session

Let's start with the most popular workflow—brainstorming with Carson.

### Load the Brainstorming Coach

In a fresh chat, load Carson:

```
/cis-brainstorm
```

### Run the Session

Carson will ask what you want to brainstorm about. Provide a topic—anything from "improving user onboarding" to "new product ideas for pet owners."

Carson guides you through:

1. **Topic exploration** — Understanding what you're brainstorming
2. **Technique selection** — Choose from 36 techniques or let Carson recommend one
3. **Ideation** — Carson facilitates using "Yes, and..." methodology
4. **Idea capture** — Results saved to `_bmad-output/brainstorming-{date}.md`

### Example Session

```
You: /cis-brainstorm
Carson: What would you like to brainstorm about?
You: Ways to reduce user churn
Carson: Let's explore this! I recommend the SCAMPER technique...
    [Guides you through 7 creative angles]
    [Generates diverse, actionable ideas]
```

## Step 2: Human-Centered Design with Maya

When you need to design solutions for real people, Maya's design thinking workflow helps you empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test.

### Load the Design Thinking Coach

```
/cis-design-thinking
```

### The Five Phases

| Phase | What Happens |
| ----- | ------------ |
| **Empathize** | Understand user needs and pain points |
| **Define** | Frame the problem from user perspective |
| **Ideate** | Generate diverse solutions |
| **Prototype** | Create rapid testable artifacts |
| **Test** | Validate with real users |

### What You Get

Output saved to `_bmad-output/design-thinking-{date}.md`:

- Design challenge statement and point-of-view
- User insights and empathy mapping
- "How Might We" questions
- Solution concepts with prototypes
- Test plans and iteration roadmap

## Step 3: Strategic Innovation with Victor

Victor helps you find disruption opportunities and business model innovation.

### Load the Innovation Strategist

```
/cis-innovation-strategy
```

### Strategic Analysis

Victor guides you through:

1. **Market landscape** — Competitive dynamics and trends
2. **Jobs-to-be-Done** — What users are actually trying to accomplish
3. **Blue Ocean Strategy** — Find uncontested market space
4. **Business model innovation** — New ways to create and capture value

### What You Get

Output saved to `_bmad-output/innovation-strategy-{date}.md`:

- Market disruption analysis
- Innovation opportunity mapping
- Business model canvas alternatives
- Strategic priorities and implementation roadmap

## Step 4: Systematic Problem-Solving with Dr. Quinn

For complex, stubborn problems, Dr. Quinn applies systematic methodologies to find root causes and effective solutions.

### Load the Problem Solver

```
/cis-problem-solving
```

### The Analytical Process

Dr. Quinn treats problems like puzzles:

1. **Problem diagnosis** — Separate symptoms from root causes
2. **Framework selection** — TRIZ, Theory of Constraints, Five Whys, Systems Thinking
3. **Solution generation** — Multiple approaches evaluated
4. **Implementation planning** — Actionable steps with risk mitigation

### What You Get

Output saved to `_bmad-output/problem-solution-{date}.md`:

- Root cause analysis
- Solution evaluation matrix
- Implementation plan with metrics
- Risk mitigation strategies

## Step 5: Storytelling with Sophia

When you need to persuade, inspire, or connect, Sophia crafts compelling narratives.

### Load the Storyteller

```
/cis-storytelling
```

### Narrative Development

Sophia guides you through:

1. **Purpose definition** — What should the audience feel/think/do?
2. **Framework selection** — Hero's Journey, Story Brand, Three-Act, and more
3. **Character development** — Relatable protagonists and authentic voice
4. **Narrative arc** — Tension, climax, and resolution
5. **Platform adaptation** — Tailored for your medium

### What You Get

Output saved to `_bmad-output/story-{date}.md`:

- Complete narrative with emotional beats
- Character development and dialogue
- Sensory details and vivid moments
- Platform-specific formatting

## Common Questions

**How do I provide context to a workflow?**

Use the `--data` flag with a file path:

```bash
workflow cis-design-thinking --data /path/to/user-research.md
```

**Can I use multiple CIS workflows together?**

Yes. Start with brainstorming to generate options, then use design thinking to refine user-centered solutions, or innovation strategy to evaluate business potential.

**What's the difference between problem-solving and design thinking?**

Design thinking focuses on user needs and rapid prototyping. Problem-solving applies analytical frameworks to find root causes and evaluate solutions systematically.

**Do I need to use all workflows?**

No. Each workflow stands alone. Use the ones that match your current challenge.
